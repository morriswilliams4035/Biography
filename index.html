    <h1> Morris Williams</h1>
    <h2> Bio </h2>
  <p style="color:white;"> My name is Morris Williams and I am a 10th grader at Baltimore Polytechnic Institue. My high school has an amazing website where you can browse their programs and see if you would like to become part of the Poly family. In order to do so <a href="https://www.bpi.edu/">click here.</a> I like to read, travel, listen to music, and play video games. My birthday is on May 31st and I am 15 years old. I am a born and raised Baltimorian but my family is from Boston and South Carolina. I want to learn multiple coding languages so I can go into different areas of computer science. Web development or game development are my top 2 choices and so I though I would learn HTML,CSS, and js first.  </p>

<h3> Purpose </h3>
  <p style="color:white;" style="font-family: 'Oswald', sans-serif;"> I wanted to learn HTML and CSS because they are languages that are widely used and can be applied to multiple fields within computer science.I also feel as though HTML is a easier coding language than the others, therefore I decided on learning it during this year of CodeWorks. I am working towards getting an internship at a  web or game development company, however, I am not sure which one as of right now. I may want to have an internship at ea gaming studios though. You can see their games and other aspects of the company <a href="https://www.ea.com/games"> here</a>.</p>
